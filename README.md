This application includes features such as "Translation" and "Text Extraction from Images" utilizing Firebase ML Kit technology. With the translation feature, you can easily translate text from one language to another either by typing in the Textview or speaking through the microphone provided below the Textview. The text and speech will be converted into the desired language. An amazing feature of this app is that it can also read out the translated text when you click on the microphone icon.
The second feature of this app is the ability to extract text from images.
